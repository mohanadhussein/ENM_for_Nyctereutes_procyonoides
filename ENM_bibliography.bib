                    During the last century, the practice of fur farming in Europe led to the introduction of two mammal species from opposite ends of the world. With their subsequent unintentional escape from captivity or intentional releases, the process of slow expansion and establishment in Europe began. The raccoon
                    Procyon lotor
                    and the raccoon dog
                    Nyctereutes procyonoides
                    are included on the European Union’s list of invasive alien species.
                  
                
                
                  We characterised the current climatic niches of the two species in their native ranges in North America and Asia, and compared them with their non‐native‐range niches in Europe, where we also projected climatic suitability. The aim was to locate suitable habitats beyond their current ranges and assess where a range expansion can be expected.
                
                
                  Niche comparison and the projection of climatic suitability in Europe were based on eight bioclimatic variables and presence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database. For niche modelling, we applied the maximum entropy approach (Maxent) and used the native‐range data for training.
                
                
                  Minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio06) was identified as the most important bioclimatic variable in the habitat suitability models for both species. Different tolerance levels regarding this variable might explain small differences between the species’ projected ranges, especially in the north and east of Europe. The high niche unfilling for both species in Europe suggests a potential for expansion beyond their present ranges.
                
                
                  
                    With only little understanding of their ecological impacts in their new ranges, including the potential risk of
                    Nyctereutes procyonoides
                    as SARS‐CoV‐2 reservoir hosts, further research and management is required at various spatial scales in Europe.},

              We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km
              2
              ). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin‐plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite‐derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the
              MODIS
              satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross‐validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high‐quality network of climate station data.},

Project: These data have been generated as part of the internationally-coordinated Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; see also GMD Special Issue: http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/special\_issue590.html). The simulation data provides a basis for climate research designed to answer fundamental science questions and serves as resource for authors of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6). CMIP6 is a project coordinated by the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) as part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Phase 6 builds on previous phases executed under the leadership of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and relies on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) and the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) along with numerous related activities for implementation. The original data is hosted and partially replicated on a federated collection of data nodes, and most of the data relied on by the IPCC is being archived for long-term preservation at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (IPCC DDC) hosted by the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ). The project includes simulations from about 120 global climate models and around 45 institutions and organizations worldwide. - Project website: https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6.},

            Species distribution modeling (SDM) is widely used in ecology and conservation. Currently, the most available data for SDM are species presence‐only records (available through digital databases). There have been many studies comparing the performance of alternative algorithms for modeling presence‐only data. Among these, a 2006 paper from Elith and colleagues has been particularly influential in the field, partly because they used several novel methods (at the time) on a global data set that included independent presence–absence records for model evaluation. Since its publication, some of the algorithms have been further developed and new ones have emerged. In this paper, we explore patterns in predictive performance across methods, by reanalyzing the same data set (225 species from six different regions) using updated modeling knowledge and practices. We apply well‐established methods such as generalized additive models and MaxEnt, alongside others that have received attention more recently, including regularized regressions, point‐process weighted regressions, random forests, XGBoost, support vector machines, and the ensemble modeling framework biomod. All the methods we use include background samples (a sample of environments in the landscape) for model fitting. We explore impacts of using weights on the presence and background points in model fitting. We introduce new ways of evaluating models fitted to these data, using the area under the precision‐recall gain curve, and focusing on the rank of results. We find that the way models are fitted matters. The top method was an ensemble of tuned individual models. In contrast, ensembles built using the biomod framework with default parameters performed no better than single moderate performing models. Similarly, the second top performing method was a random forest parameterized to deal with many background samples (contrasted to relatively few presence records), which substantially outperformed other random forest implementations. We find that, in general, nonparametric techniques with the capability of controlling for model complexity outperformed traditional regression methods, with MaxEnt and boosted regression trees still among the top performing models. All the data and code with working examples are provided to make this study fully reproducible.},

                  Climate change research often relies on downscaled general circulation models (GCM), projections of future scenarios that are used to build ecological and evolutionary models. With more than 35 different GCMs widely available at a resolution of 10 km and finer, standardized methods to understand the differences among GCM projections in a region of interest and to choose which GCM to use for analysis are essential to maximize relevance to policy and to assure a proper treatment of uncertainty.
                
                
                  
                    To help researchers and policymakers understand and select form the range of available GCM scenarios, we have developed GCM
                    compare
                    R, an open‐source web application written in
                    r

                    shiny
                    . GCM
                    compare
                    R is freely accessible with an easy interactive user interface, has preloaded climate scenario data to increase the speed of analysis and is fully documented to ensure reproducibility. Users of the application need no prior experience in coding.

                    compare
                    R is designed to compare GCMs and different climate change scenarios to provide full, documented exploration of the possible alternative futures from within the range of projections in CMIP5 climate models. Designed with a wide group of users in mind, including ecologists, conservationists and policymakers, the application is designed to adapt analyses to any geographic area of interest. Results are provided as figures, tables and maps that clearly communicate the differences among model projections for the region. Additionally, the tool allows for the export of a report that records the parameter choices and results of a session, along with contextual information, to make the analysis fully transparent and replicable.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are practical tools to assess the
habitat suitability of species with numerous applications in
environmental management and conservation planning. The manipulation of
the input data to deal with their spatial bias is one of the
advantageous methods to enhance the performance of SDMs. However, the
development of a model parameterization approach covering different SDMs
to achieve well-performing models has never been implemented. We
integrated input data manipulation and model tuning for four
commonly-used SDMs; generalized linear model (GLM), gradient boosted
model (GBM), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and
compared their predictive performance to model geographically imbalanced
biased data of a rare species complex of mountain vipers. Models were
tuned up based on a range of model-specific parameters considering two
background selection methods; random and background weighting schemes.
The performance of the fine-tuned models was assessed based on a
recently identified localities of the species. The results indicated
that although the fine-tuned version of all models shows great
performance in predicting training data (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9 and TSS
{\textgreater} 0.5), they produce different results in classifying
out-of-bag data. The GBM and RF with higher sensitivity of training data
showed more different performances. The GLM, despite having high
predictive performance for test data, showed lower specificity. It was
only the MaxEnt model that showed high predictive performance and
comparable results for identifying test data in both random and
background weighting procedures. Our results highlight that while GBM
and RF are prone to overfitting training data and GLM over-predict
non-sampled areas MaxEnt is capable of producing results that are both
predictable (extrapolative) and complex (interpolative). We discuss the
assumptions of each model and conclude that MaxEnt could be considered
as a practical method to cope with imbalanced-biased data in species
distribution modeling approaches.},
